# 🚗 Toyota Corolla Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
This project involves building a **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** model to predict the price of used Toyota Corolla cars using various car attributes.
## 📁 Files in this Repository
- `ToyotaCorolla.xls` — Dataset containing features of used Toyota Corolla cars.
- `MLR.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook that performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age of the car
- KM driven
- Fuel type
- HP (Horse Power)
- Automatic (Yes/No)
- Doors, Gears, Weight, and other specifications
- Price (target variable)
## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualize feature relationships and distributions.
- Build a Multiple Linear Regression model.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like R² and RMSE.
## 🔧 Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
## 📈 Model Summary
The Multiple Linear Regression model helps in understanding how various car features influence the price. Feature selection and assumptions of linear regression are considered during analysis.
## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of regression techniques on real-world data and provides insights for pricing strategies in the used car market.
